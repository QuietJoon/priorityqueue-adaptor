priorityqueue-adaptor
====

Adaptor to switch among priority queue packages simply

## Supported priority queue packages

* pqueue

## Planned priority queue packages

* min-max-pqueue
* psqueues
* PSQueue
* queuelike
* priority-queue
* fingertree-psqueue

## Why do I need adaptor series?

Not only for unified function interface, but for benchmarking and comparing the performance of each packages.

When you write a comparing benchmark, you may not need this.
However, when you write a real application, you may want to adaptor which helps easy switching among the packages.
